I’ll keep updating this as they progress.</p> <p>Here’s the first email that I had sent to a mentee (with some bits removed).</p> <hr> <p>A short introduction - I’m Vineeth, a UG4 CSE Honours student under Prof. Madhava Krishna. I’ve worked on Visual Place Recognition, Video Object Detection, Object Identification and Localization, and am currently focused on building a navigation stack (lots of robotics terms - you’ll learn them as you go).</p> <p>Considering that you probably won’t be doing courses such as DASS and ISS (<em>some introductory courses for CS majors at IIIT on software</em>) that give you a glance into Software Engineering, and since it is vital part of running any experiment successfully, I would like to get you started off with reading the following (skim, don’t go much in-depth):</p> <ol> <li>An Introduction to Abstraction (<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHSBRLWY5bzZdchFF/a-thorough-introduction-to-abstraction" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">link</a>)</li> <li>Writing Modular Code (<a href="https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/modular_code.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">link</a>)</li> <li>Python for Research (<a href="https://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/doctoral-programming-intro/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">link</a>, please skim this - see the headings and figure out whether you know the general information in it)</li> </ol> <p>I expect this to take 2-3 days at most, and will then give you resources for:</p> <ol> <li>ROS (Please dual boot with Ubuntu 20 for this; If you use some other Linux Distro, check compatibility)</li> <li>Basic Optimization Theory (Brush up on your linear algebra for this)</li> <li>Neural Networks and DL (Basics of ML)</li> <li>Post this, I would like to introduce you to some concepts in computer vision (such as camera matrices, key-point descriptors, multi-view geometry, etc.), take you into larger networks such as CNNs &amp; Transformers, and SLAM.</li> </ol> <hr> <h3 id="installing-ros">Installing ROS</h3> <ol> <li>Set up dual boot with Ubuntu 20.04 (make sure the version matches).</li> <li>Install ROS following the instructions for <a href="https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Noetic</a>. <ul> <li>If you’re adventurous, try Zorin OS. Its installation is similar to Ubuntu.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For a modern approach, consider Docker. While dual booting is recommended for ROS, Docker is a valuable and intriguing tool worth exploring. <ul> <li><a href="https://roboticseabass.com/2021/04/21/docker-and-ros/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Resource 1</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROS/comments/19d3fgk/running_ros_in_docker_pros_and_cons/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Resource 2</a></li> </ul> </li> </ol> <h2 id="week-2-getting-started-with-ros">Week 2: getting started with ROS</h2> <h3 id="a-very-very-gentle-introduction">A very, very gentle introduction</h3> <p>Check <a href="https://app.theconstruct.ai/courses/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this</a> out.
