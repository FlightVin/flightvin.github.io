A Final-year CS Undergrad at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&nlp&inforet&comm&mobile&metrics&chi&robotics&bed&visualization&in) and an ex-intern at [D.E. Shaw and Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/)

I've found that the best way to present my undergrad is that I've explored extensively (*read: dabbled*) across *Systems* and *ML* -  
I've built projects around software & distributed systems as well as foundation models (Robotics, AI Safety, Computer Vision). 

What are my plans now? I'll update the narrative once I start my job at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) :)  

Iâ€™m always open to new things  
(Industry & Academic collabs, Fantasy Novels, Philosophy?)
