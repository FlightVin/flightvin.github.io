Hi there! I'm Vineeth. I'm intersted in building intelligent systems we can trust.

I recently graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) (July, 2025) and currently work as a Software Engineer.

My research background spans Robotics and AI Safety. You could check out short descriptions on my publications [here](/publications/) and some blogs [here](https://vineethbhat.com/all-of-my-blogs-in-one-place/).
