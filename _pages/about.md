A Final-year CS Undergrad at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://csrankings.org/#/index?ai&vision&nlp&inforet&comm&mobile&metrics&chi&robotics&bed&visualization&in) and an ex-intern at [D.E. Shaw and Co.](https://www.deshaw.com/).

I think I like ML and Software.  
*Good old Foundation Models, Robotics, Software Arch and Distributed Systems*  
*With a teeny-tiny bit of interpretability and AI safety these days.*  

I'm always open to new things  
*(Industry & Academic collabs, Fantasy Novels, Philosophy?)*
