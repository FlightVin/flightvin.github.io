Hi there! I'm Vineeth. I'm intersted in building intelligent systems we can trust.

I recently graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) (July, 2025) and currently work as a Software Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

My research background spans Robotics and AI Safety. My trajectory—from classical SLAM through learned policies to interpretability—positions me uniquely to bridge control theory and foundation model research.

You could check out short descriptions on my publications [here](/publications/) and some blogs [here](https://vineethbhat.com/all-of-my-blogs-in-one-place/).
