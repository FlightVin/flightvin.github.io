Hi there! I'm Vineeth. I'm intersted in building intelligent systems we can trust.

I recently graduated from [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) (July, 2025) and currently work as a Software Engineer at [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).

My research background spans Robotics and AI Safety. I have worked on making autonomous navigation more reliable and developing consistency checks for large language models.

What's next for me? I want to focus on safe robot learning. I want to bridge the gap between the impressive capabilities of modern embodied AI and the rigorous reliability required for their real-world deployment.

You could check out short descriptions on my publications [here](/publications/) and some blogs [here](https://vineethbhat.com/all-of-my-blogs-in-one-place/).
